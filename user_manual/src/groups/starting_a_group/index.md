# Starting a new group

A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, have discussions and make decisions about work.

Groups are all about people. So it is advisable to think about the people you are going to invite; 
- Who are they? 
- What is the purpose of your group? 
- What work are you going to do together? 
- What objectives do you need to achieve? 
- What do people need to know to participate effectively?

You can start a new Loomio group at any time from the sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

**Group page**
Your Group home page is the first place people will see when they arrive. It should contain a description of your group; it's purpose, an outline of the work you are going to do, and any other information to help people to participate.

Your group will have an image that represents something about your organization.

## Group details

### Group name

Type your group name. It's best to keep your group name short and concise.

### Group handle

By default, Loomio will make this `your-group-name` but you can choose any unused, alphanumeric handle (hyphens optional). Navigating to the URL loomio.org/[your-group-handle] will take you directly to your group page.

### Category selection

You may be asked to select a category that best describes your group, so we help you with relevant information.

**Your new group is created!**

### Group description

Add a description to help people arrive and participate.

The description should give members a clear understanding of the purpose or scope of the group. Some examples:

"_A public group for us to approve requests for use of the gallery space_"

"_The space for our board members to consider budget proposals_"

**Add a Group description** by navigating to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and use the form that appears (click save when done).

With a clear purpose, people can make judgment calls about what's best for the group. Understanding group context helps people get oriented.

### Group description is also a Resource hub

Your Loomio **group page** is a place to store all of the information, links, and files that everyone in your group needs. Update the Group description field and attach files from your computer or from the cloud.

**Tip:** Group descriptions are a great place to include reasons why you're using Loomio. Sharing why you're implementing Loomio can help motivate people to adopt it.

## Upload a group photo

Uploading a photo or image that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging. You can also add a logo which will appear alongside your group name in the sidebar menu.  Click on the image and logo to upload your file.

The ideal pixel resolution for the group image is 2048 x 512. But any image with aspect ratio of 4:1 will fit.

You can always return to change these by visiting **Edit group settings** on the **Settings** tab of your group page.
