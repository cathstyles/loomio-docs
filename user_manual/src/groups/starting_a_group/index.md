# Starting a new group

Starting a new group will depend upon your Loomio service:

### Starting a new group on loomio.org - available globally

You can start a new Loomio group at any time on a free trial at:
- loomio.com - click on the **Try Loomio for Free** button, or,
- sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

### Starting a new group on a regional service - limited availability

Loomio service running on local secure servers is available in some regions.  See loomio.com/pricing for current details.

Contact us to start a new Loomio group on a regional service.

### Starting a new group on a private or self-hosted service

You can start a new Loomio group at any time from the sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

## Group details

You can always return to change these by visiting **Edit group settings** on the **Settings** tab of your group page.

### Group name

It's best to keep your group name short and concise.

### Group handle

By default, Loomio will make this `your-group-name` but you can choose any unused, alphanumeric handle (hyphens optional). Navigating to the URL loomio.org/[your-group-handle] will take you directly to your group page.

### Group description

Add a description to help people arrive and participate.

The description should give members a clear understanding of the purpose or scope of the group. Some examples:

"_A public group for us to approve requests for use of the gallery space_"

"_The space for our board members to consider budget proposals_"

**Add a Group description** by navigating to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and use the form that appears (click save when done).

With a clear purpose, people can make judgment calls about what's best for the group. Understanding group context helps people get oriented.

### Group description is also a Resource hub

Your Loomio **group page** is a place to store all of the information, links, and files that everyone in your group needs. Update the Group description field and attach files from your computer or from the cloud.

**Tip:** Group descriptions are a great place to include reasons why you're using Loomio. Sharing why you're implementing Loomio can help motivate people to adopt it.

## Privacy

Go to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and go to the **Privacy** tab. Click **Update Settings** when done.

Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join.

The recommended privacy setting for new groups is **Secret**. This means everything is private to those invited members of the group. No one will know about this group (or subgroup) unless you invite them.

If you want the content of your discussions and decisions to be public, change your group privacy to **Open**. The members list will only be visible to other members.

Many groups also use **Closed**, to allow people to find your group and ask to join. The **Name** and **Group description** as well as links and attached files are publicly accessible in Closed groups.

**NOTE:** If you have a **Closed** or **Secret** group and change it to **Open**, all threads will become public. Changing an **Open** group to **Closed** or **Secret** will make all threads private.

Open groups may contain secret and closed subgroups.

A member of an open group can see the closed subgroup but not the secret ones.

## Permissions




## Upload a group photo

Uploading a photo or image that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging. You can also add a logo which will appear alongside your group name in the sidebar menu.  Click on the image and logo to upload your file.

## Invite people

Go to your group page and click the **Members** tab to access member management

Click one of two options

1. **Invite**: If you have their email addresses, you can send invitations to each member of your group.
2. **Share**: Or you can share the **Reusable invitation link** via email or however your team communicates.

<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RGv0Yq6sv8g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If your group's privacy is **closed** then you can invite people by sharing your `loomio.org/handle`. When people arrive at your group page, they will see the title, the description, and a button **Join group** to request membership. As administrator of the group, you will receive an email where you can approve the request.

> Reminder: Closed groups disclose their Group Name, Group Description with links and file attachments publicly.

Follow up on people who don't make it into the group and give them a nudge. 

If people join but don't begin to participate right away, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention, for example:

> “Welcome to the group @Jane, it's great to have you here! Please tell us something about your work and interests.”

## Champion the use of Loomio

If you model behavior for others to emulate, your group will be more inclusive and engaging. You play an important role in helping deliberation and communication progress constructively.

For example:

> - “@Jane that could be a good idea, why don’t you raise a proposal so we can see if the rest of the group agrees?”
- “We haven’t heard from @Bill and @Ngaire … what are your thoughts?”
- “We might be getting off topic here. I've started another Loomio discussion about that [here](http://www.loomio.org). Let's bring this back to the original focus.”

## Developing a productive Loomio habit

**If discussions happen via email,** remind the group you've agreed to use Loomio and request people move the discussion over there. Sometimes it can be helpful to copy and paste what's been said so far and directly give everyone the Loomio link.

**If decisions are being made in-person,** invite the group to move the discussion online before concluding the decision with an outcome.

It's good to name one or more reasons _why_ you're moving back to Loomio. A couple common reasons:

- to include people who aren't in the room
- to create documentation for future reference.

**Raising the stakes** is another strategy for accelerating the adoption of Loomio. An example illustrates it best: _"Want to participate in the decision? You'll have to voice your position on Loomio"_. When taking this approach it is good to accompany this candor with _care_. Kindness – _and, again, a reminder of the reason you're using Loomio_ – can help at most steps of your journey.
