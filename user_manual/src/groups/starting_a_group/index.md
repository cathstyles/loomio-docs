# Starting a new group

A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, have discussions and make decisions about work.

Groups are all about people. So it is advisable to think about the people you are going to invite; 
- Who are they? 
- What is the purpose of your group? 
- What work are you going to do together? 
- What objectives do you need to achieve? 
- What do people need to know to participate effectively?

You can start a new Loomio group at any time from the sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

## Group details

### Group name

Type your group name. It's best to keep your group name short and concise.

### Group handle

By default, Loomio will make this `your-group-name` but you can choose any unused, alphanumeric handle (hyphens optional). Navigating to the URL loomio.org/[your-group-handle] will take you directly to your group page.

### Category selection

You may be asked to select a category that best describes your group, so we help you with relevant information.

**Your new group is created!**

## Group home page

Your Group home page is the first place people will see when they arrive. It should contain a description of your group; it's purpose, an outline of the work you are going to do, and any other information to help people to participate.

1. In the Group description box write a clear purpose for why you have set up this group and a reason why people should join. 

2. What will you use Loomio for? *For example; "We will use this online place for our team to progress our work between meetings, have discussions and make decisions. It will help us engage more effectively and operate transparently, and save time in meetings and replace confusing email chains."*

3. Consider what kind of decisions or outcomes you will achieve in this group. Is there a project time-frame you are working to? *For example; “We will use Loomio to prioritize our work and to reach agreement on a way forwards. Our aim is to prepare a draft document to share with stakeholders in the next month, and have a new document agreed by the end of the quarter."*

4. Consider who is involved and what you expect of each other. *For example; “This is a private group initially for just our team. We may open the group to stakeholders, or set up a new subgroup for engaging with stakeholders. We encourage you to contribute on threads, and raise new topics by starting a new thread."*

5. Consider how Loomio will complement your existing processes. *For example; “We will use Loomio to prepare for and agree agenda items for meetings, prepare and upload draft papers and documents, agree actions and approve minutes, and progress discussions on issues we do not have time to cover during meetings."*

### Your group home page is also a resource hub

Your Loomio group page is a place to store all of the information, links, and files that everyone in your group needs. Update the Group description field and attach files from your computer or from the cloud.

**Tip:** Group descriptions are a great place to include reasons why you're using Loomio. Saying why you're introducing Loomio can help motivate people engage.
