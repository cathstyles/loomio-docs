# Prepare your group 

A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, have discussions and make decisions about work.

Groups are all about people. So think about the people you are going to invite; 
- Who are they? 
- What is the purpose of your group? 
- What work are you going to do together? 
- What objectives do you need to achieve? 
- What do people need to know to participate effectively?

## Group home page

The group home page is the first place people will see when they arrive to your group - make them welcome, and make it their home!

Add a cover image and logo that represents your group. Use the group description to help people understand the purpose of the group, what work you are going to do, and include any other information that helps them participate.

### Your group home page is also a resource hub

Your Loomio group page is a place to store all of the information, links and files, that everyone in your group needs.

**Tip:** Group descriptions are a great place to include reasons why you're using Loomio. Saying why you're introducing Loomio can help motivate people engage.

## Starting a new group

You can start a new Loomio group at any time from the sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

### Group details

![](new-group-start.png#width-90)

#### Group name

Type your group name. It's best to keep your group name short and concise.

#### Group handle

By default, Loomio will make this `your-group-name` but you can choose any unused, alphanumeric handle (hyphens optional). Navigating to the URL loomio.org/[your-group-handle] will take you directly to your group page.

#### Category selection

You may be asked to select a category that best describes your group, so we help you with relevant information.

**When you click 'Start Group' your new group is automatically created!**
