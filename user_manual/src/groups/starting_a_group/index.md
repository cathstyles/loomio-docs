# Starting a new group

Starting a new group will depend upon your Loomio service:

### Starting a new group on loomio.org - available globally

You can start a new Loomio group at any time on a free trial at:
- loomio.com - click on the **Try Loomio for Free** button, or,
- sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

### Starting a new group on a regional service - limited availability

Loomio service running on local secure servers is available in some regions.  See loomio.com/pricing for current details.

Contact us to start a new Loomio group on a regional service.

### Starting a new group on a private or self-hosted service

You can start a new Loomio group at any time from the sidebar menu - click on **New group**.

## Group details

You can always return to change these by visiting **Edit group settings** on the **Settings** tab of your group page.

### Group name

It's best to keep your group name short and concise.

### Group handle

By default, Loomio will make this `your-group-name` but you can choose any unused, alphanumeric handle (hyphens optional). Navigating to the URL loomio.org/[your-group-handle] will take you directly to your group page.

### Group description

Add a description to help people arrive and participate.

The description should give members a clear understanding of the purpose or scope of the group. Some examples:

"_A public group for us to approve requests for use of the gallery space_"

"_The space for our board members to consider budget proposals_"

**Add a Group description** by navigating to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and use the form that appears (click save when done).

With a clear purpose, people can make judgment calls about what's best for the group. Understanding group context helps people get oriented.

### Group description is also a Resource hub

Your Loomio **group page** is a place to store all of the information, links, and files that everyone in your group needs. Update the Group description field and attach files from your computer or from the cloud.

**Tip:** Group descriptions are a great place to include reasons why you're using Loomio. Sharing why you're implementing Loomio can help motivate people to adopt it.

## Privacy

Go to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and go to the **Privacy** tab. Click **Update Settings** when done.

Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join.

The recommended privacy setting for new groups is **Secret**. This means everything is private to those invited members of the group. No one will know about this group (or subgroup) unless you invite them.

If you want the content of your discussions and decisions to be public, change your group privacy to **Open**. The members list will only be visible to other members.

Many groups also use **Closed**, to allow people to find your group and ask to join. The **Name** and **Group description** as well as links and attached files are publicly accessible in Closed groups.

**NOTE:** If you have a **Closed** or **Secret** group and change it to **Open**, all threads will become public. Changing an **Open** group to **Closed** or **Secret** will make all threads private.

Open groups may contain secret and closed subgroups.

A member of an open group can see the closed subgroup but not the secret ones.

## Permissions




## Upload a group photo

Uploading a photo or image that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging. You can also add a logo which will appear alongside your group name in the sidebar menu.  Click on the image and logo to upload your file.
