# Group Settings
_Permissions and advanced group settings._

Only a group's admin can see and edit group settings. As Admin you can change group permissions and configure what members can do in any group or subgroup by:

1. navigating to the **Settings** tab of your group's page
2. selecting **Edit Group Settings**
3. clicking a tab (**Privacy** or **Permissions** options are described below)

## Privacy

Go to the **Settings** tab on your group page. Click **Edit Group Settings** and go to the **Privacy** tab. Click **Update Settings** when done.

Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join.

The recommended privacy setting for new groups is **Secret**. This means everything is private to those invited members of the group. No one will know about this group (or subgroup) unless you invite them.

If you want the content of your discussions and decisions to be public, change your group privacy to **Open**. The members list will only be visible to other members.

Many groups also use **Closed**, to allow people to find your group and ask to join. The **Name** and **Group description** as well as links and attached files are publicly accessible in Closed groups.

**NOTE:** If you have a **Closed** or **Secret** group and change it to **Open**, all threads will become public. Changing an **Open** group to **Closed** or **Secret** will make all threads private.

Open groups may contain secret and closed subgroups.

A member of an open group can see the closed subgroup but not the secret ones.

## Permissions

Most of the permissions settings only affect what **members** can do. Members are the users in your group who are _not_ [Admins](#admin).

### Anyone can join (Open groups)

In _open groups_ you can use the option, **Anyone can join**, in order for the public to be able to join without any action by any member of the group.

### Requiring approval of membership requests (Open groups)

If you select this option, rather than letting people walk in the door voluntarily (self-select to join your group), then admin will have the option to approve or ignore people's requests to join.

- You can also give group members the permission to approve requests, also in the **Permissions** tab of Group Settings.

### Allow members of parent group to see threads

In _closed subgroups_ you can allow members of the parent group to see discussions within the subgroup.
Select, **Members of [parent group] can see private threads** to enable this feature. This feature is off by default. For more on subgroups, [see here](../subgroups).

### Members can invite people and approve requests to join

This allows everyone in your group to invite new people in, and approve any membership requests. When it is deselected only group admin will be able to invite and approve new members.

### Members can notify everyone in group

When ticked, any Member will be able to use **notify** and [**invite people**](../../threads/notifying_people/#send-thread), sending notifications immediately to some, or all, of the group. Unless your group is very big, Loomio recommends you leave this on.

### Create subgroups

This allows everyone in your group to create subgroups. When it is deselected only group admin will be able to create subgroups.

### Start threads

This allows everyone in your group to start new threads. When it is deselected only group admin will be able to start discussions.

### Edit the context of any thread in the group

This allows everyone in your group to edit the context of any thread. When it is deselected only group admin and the thread author will be able to edit the thread context.

### Edit their comments at any time

This allows everyone in your group to edit their comments at any time. When it is deselected, a comment can only be edited until someone else participates in the thread.

### Raise proposals

This allows anyone in your group to start a proposal within a thread. When this box is deselected only group admin will be able to raise proposals and polls.

### Vote on proposals

This allows everyone in your group to state their position on proposals. When it is deselected only group admin will be able to state their position on proposals and polls.

## Thread view settings

Thread **activity** is comprised of all the comments, replies, proposals, polls, votes and other notable things that happen within the thread. You can alter how that activity is displayed in order to optimize the experience for your group. These settings change the default layout for everyone in your group, but can be adjusted for each thread to serve  a specific purpose:

### Oldest or Newest first

By default, threads are set to **Oldest** listed with the oldest activity nearest the top. You can change the thread flow by switching to **Newest** so that the newest activity is at the top of the thread.

### Flat or Nested replies

The thread can also be set to display chronologically, as a **flat list**, where all activity is displayed in the order that it happened, or as **nested replies** of one or two levels. 

Nested replies keeps replies to comments together, and is very helpful to easily see mini-discussions within an overall thread.

Click **Save** to exit.
