To get the most out of the effectiveness and efficiency that Loomio offers, you may want to manage the discussion threads and the communications they contain.

While some of these actions are taken from _within_ threads, we'll start outside the threads, on any page where threads are listed (Group, Unread threads, or Recent threads page).

## Understanding thread previews

To help you stay on top of everything, the thread preview is a quick glance at the some important details about a thread. Thread previews appear on any page that lists threads.

![](thread_preview.png)

It shows

- The title
- Who first authored it - _the picture or initials to the left of the title_
- If it has an active proposal or poll - _a relevant visual/graph will replace the author_

> _Note:_ your participation (eg, Agree) is superimposed on this graph. A question mark indicates you have not participated

- What group or subgroup it is in - _just below the title_
- How many comments or votes - _X replies_
- If there has been activity that you haven't seen yet - _yellow stripe on the left_
- How many of these you have yet to see - _Y unread_
- When the last comment or vote was submitted - _Last active Z ago_

# Top-level options

You can access a number of options by selecting the three horizontal dots (**⋯**) to the right of a thread's title , opening the **thread preview options**. The following administrative actions are taken from those options (only on pages that list threads).

### Pin thread
If you are a coordinator, you can pin comments to order them and make them easier to find. Pinned threads will appear above your other threads and will be ordered by latest activity within their group and organization.

You can easily  **pin** or **un-pin** from the thread preview options, but **only from the Group page**.

### Close thread

To keep the list of discussions on your group page relevant, you can close threads which people don't need to see.

![](close_thread.png)

To view closed threads, first navigate to the relevant **group page**. You will need to use the drop-down just under the Threads tab to change the thread filter from its default of **open**.

![](sort_threads_on_group_page.png)

Choose "closed" to view all your closed threads in the thread filter.

![](closed_threads.png)

#### Re-open thread

Re-opening a closed thread is done from within the thread's page – again, the three horizontal dots (**⋯**). See [organizing threads](#thread-options-and-organizing-threads) for a depiction.

### Category tags

**Category tags** (or just "tags") let you group any number of threads by categories that you define. Use the thread context's **edit** button to add or remove tags once a thread has been started. Add tags as you start the thread, [learn all about it](../starting_threads/#category-tags).

#### Navigating using category tags

You can click on tags from within threads or use them from your group page; learn more about [sorting threads by tag](../../users/navigation/#Category-Tags-help-you-sort-threads).

# Options within threads

## Thread context

Threads are easily updated and edited by those with permission to by clicking **edit**.

> **Tip:** Double-clicking a thread context also opens the context editor.

Learn more about thread contexts [here](../engaging_with_threads/#thread-context).

## Thread Options and Organizing threads

The following administrative actions may be taken from within the thread, and in some cases from pages that list threads (thread preview options). To find these options, go to the page of the thread in question and use the **⋯** three horizontal dots to the right of the basic thread actions at the bottom of the context.

![](options_from_thread_context.png)

### Move thread

You may want to move threads between groups and subgroups to keep things organised. To do this, select **move to group** from the additional options

### Delete thread

If you're the admin of a group you can delete any thread – or comments in any of the threads – in the group.

If you started a thread, you can delete that thread, but only your comments within it.

## Invite guests to thread

Consult an expert or external party while keeping relevant communications all in one place: Invite them to a specific thread by clicking **members**, at the bottom of the thread's context. They won't get access to any other threads in your group, just this one. They do not need to already have a Loomio account, and they can participate by email just like all Loomio users.  _If you_ do _want them to be in the group, then invite them to join from the group page._

You can remove them (or give them permissions) by clicking the dots to the right of their name, again from the context's **members** button.

## Administering comments and decisions

The following are achieved from any comment by first clicking on the three horizontal dots (**⋯**) at the bottom-right of the comment, proposal, or poll in question.

### Deleting comments
You can delete your own comments at any time.

Again, an admin can delete any comment.

Select **delete** from the comment's options (**⋯**).

### Move items
Sometimes a comment is useful, but off-topic for the thread; _it may be a short conversation took place that would have been better held in another thread or subgroup._ In this case you will want to move one or more related comment(s) and replies by selecting **move item** in the comment's options (**⋯**). This will allow you to select any number of thread items, _including_ polls or proposals. You can then add them to a pre-existing thread of your choice, or start a new thread.

<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qaaQkA2myRc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Pin to timeline

The timeline helps you and your group to quickly access content (conversations, questions, decisions…). It is a visual, interactive history of key events, processes, or milestones that helps your group to understand how a conversation evolved over time or to review how a given outcome came about.

![timeline with key meetup dates by month](https://help.loomio.org/en/user_manual/whats_new_loomio_2/new_timeline.png)

To facilitate this, comments with headers, proposals, and polls are automatically added to the timeline as links. Clicking these links take you directly to this item in the thread.

#### Add, remove, or edit timeline items

To add, remove, or edit timeline items, either click the word **pin** or **unpin** at the bottom-right of any comment, proposal, or poll.

To edit the words used in the timeline: unpin and then pin it again; this will give you the opportunity to reword the text that appears as a link in the timeline.

> **Tip:** Highlight the words that you would like to use as the text in the timeline

## Archiving threads

In addition to [closing threads](#close-thread) or [moving threads](#move-thread), you can also archive the thread to your local device:

### Print thread

From the [thread options](#Thread-Options-and-Organizing-threads) (**⋯**), choose **print**. Then use your browser's ability to "save to pdf", or copy and paste it into the file or repository of your choosing.

## Tracking engagement

### Seen by

Just under the thread context you can click **members** to see who has or has not seen the thread.

![](thread_member_management.png)

### Notification history

You can check if someone has been sent an email notification about a thread, decision, or comment. Additionally, you can see if they have _opened_ this notification email or if they saw it on Loomio.

#### For comments and threads
In the extra options you find from the three horizontal dots (**⋯**), click **See notifications**.

#### For proposals and polls
Click on the dots (**⋯**) under the Results section of your proposal or poll, and then click **See notifications** to see who has been invited to – and who has viewed the notification of – your proposal or poll.

Here's how it looks if you sent some notifications:
