Threads are used for many purposes.  In a board, you will be invited to Threads to prepare for a board meeting, vote on resolutions, approve minutes, discuss a particular topic, ask questions, share reports and discuss any other information important for the board.

Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organization’s discussions and decisions.

### Comment

When you have written your text as a Comment in the thread, use **Post Comment** to instantly publish the comment. Your comment will be visible to anyone who has permission to see the thread. If you want to change anything you can edit the comment.

Up until the proposal closes, you can change your vote.  

There are many reasons why you might want to change your vote. For example if new information emerges it may cause you to rethink your decision, and change your vote.

### Results

Results of the proposal are updated as people vote, so you can see how a proposal is trending.

In a controversial proposal it is common to see mixed results, however this does not mean the proposal has failed.  

Often the new information revealed during the proposal helps form a better proposal that is more likely to pass.

### Outcome

When the proposal closes, the author is prompted to state the **Outcome**.

This is an important final step to record the result of the decision and let everyone know what will happen next.
