### Tips for a better experience

#### Set a password
If you don't want to check your email to sign in, you can easily set a password. To do this, take the same steps you would to [change your password](../user_profile/#resetting-your-password).

#### Don't create more than one user account
Remember to use the same email address each time you login, or you may end up with two user accounts, which will cause permission errors when you're checking notifications.

Sometimes people think they need two Loomio accounts because they have two groups and they want to keep things separated; However, Loomio is designed to support belonging to multiple groups with one user account.

### Merging user accounts
If you do find yourself with more than one user account, you can [merge them](../merge_accounts).

### You can accept an invitation sent to another email address
Invitations are not tied to the email they are sent to. If someone sends you an invitation to an email address other than the one you use for your Loomio user account, you do not need to create a new user account or get the invitation re-sent.

Just click the invitation link and replace the text in the email form with the email address you would like to use, or the email address of your existing account, as you proceed.

### You can sign in with email even if you first signed in via Google
After creating an account via a third party (eg: Google), you can still sign in with email. Just enter the email address associated with your Google account into the Email address field and **Sign in with email**.

### Linking a third party to an existing user account
If you want to sign in with a third party (eg: Google) but you already have a Loomio account with another email address, you can link your accounts. To do this, just sign in via your preferred third party, Loomio will recognize it's your first time using that sign-in method. Enter the email address of your existing account and **Link accounts** when you have the choice between this (don't click **Create account**).
