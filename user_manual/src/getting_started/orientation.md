Emails Loomio may send you include:

* **Mention and Replies** - When someone @mentions you in a comment or replies to you, you will receive a notification email.
* **Subscribe on participation** - If selected, when you participate in a thread you will receive emails for all further activity. Not recommended for most people.
* **Catch-up summary email** - The 'Yesterday on Loomio' email includes activity from all your groups and threads that you have not read yet.
* **Invitations to threads, polls and proposals** - You may receive an email when invited to a new thread, poll or proposal.
* **Reminders and Outcomes** - If you have not voted in a poll or proposal, you may receive a reminder 24 hours before close. You may also receive an email stating the outcome of a poll or proposal.

These emails are to help you participate effectively with your group. The default settings are to help you stay up to date with activity on Loomio but should not overload your email inbox.

If you are receiving too many emails from Loomio, you can change the default email settings. Talk to your group administrator to get the balance right for you.

When you receive an email from Loomio, you can reply directly from your email inbox and your reply will be posted into the Loomio thread. This works for everything except the Catch-up summary email.
