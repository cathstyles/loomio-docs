# A quick tour of Loomio

Lets take an orientation tour to help you quickly understand how to participate in discussions and decisions in your group.

## Group page

Your group home page is the first place people see when they arrive. It contains a description of why the group exists, what you will use it for, and any other information that may help you participate.

You can add an image that represents something of your organization and place.

### Tabs

Under the group description you will see tabs. Clicking on each tab displays information about:

**Threads** - A list of discussion threads showing the author, the thread title, category tag, along with some other useful information about the recent activity in the thread. 

**Polls** - A list of the polls and proposals active in your group.

**Members** - Where you can see a list of the people who are members of the group.

**Files** - Files and documents that have been uploaded to your group.

**Subgroups** - A list of subgroups that you are a member of. A subgroup is the collaborative space for a working team, project or event, a governance board, a subcommittee or stakeholders group.

**Settings** - Where administrators of the group can set and change group privacy and member permissions.

Below the tabs there is a search bar, with filters such as open or closed threads and category tags. The filters help you view a reduced set of information.

If the threads tab is selected, the thread list shows the title of the thread, author, number of replies, and when last active.

## Sidebar

The sidebar menu is accessible from the (☰) menu icon at screen top left, where you can see:

* **Unread threads** - A list of Threads you have yet to read.
* **Invite-only threads** - Private Threads that do not belong to a group.
* **Start a new thread** - Where you can start a new private Thread. 
* **Your Loomio groups** - Where you can easily find your Loomio groups and subgroups.

### User settings

Click the down arrow ( ∨ ) to open your user settings.

### Email notifications

Loomio sends emails to keep you updated on the activity in your groups. 

Emails Loomio may send you include:

* **Mention and Replies** - When someone @mentions you in a comment or replies to you, you will receive a notification email.
* **Subscribe on participation** - If selected, when you participate in a thread you will receive emails for all further activity. Not recommended for most people.
* **Catch-up summary email** - The 'Yesterday on Loomio' email includes activity from all your groups and threads that you have not read yet.
* **Invitations to threads, polls and proposals** - You may receive an email when invited to a new thread, poll or proposal.
* **Reminders and Outcomes** - If you have not voted in a poll or proposal, you may receive a reminder 24 hours before close. You may also receive an email stating the outcome of a poll or proposal.

These emails are to help you participate effectively with your group. The default settings are to help you stay up to date with activity on Loomio but should not overload your email inbox.

If you are receiving too many emails from Loomio, you can change the default email settings. Talk to your group administrator to get the balance right for you.

When you receive an email from Loomio, you can reply directly from your email inbox and your reply will be posted into the Loomio thread. This works for everything except the Catch-up summary email.

## Finding Information Quickly

There are several tools included within Loomio to help you find the information you are looking for quickly.

### Search

You can use the Search bar at the top of almost every page to search for content relevant to that page.

For example, on the Threads page typing 'decision' in the search bar brings up two threads with the work 'decision'.

### Category Tags

Category Tags make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic. 

Tags can be applied when starting or editing a Thread, Poll or Proposal.
