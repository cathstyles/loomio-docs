# Guide for Connectors

This guide is for Connectors - people with administrator access to your Loomio group.

*A connector is usually the board administrator for your Corporation, who will set up Loomio for your board and be the primary point of contact.*

---

**Purpose: To set up Loomio effectively for your board.**

**Initial objectives**
Our aim is to encourage directors to join and participate in your Loomio group. They should be easily able to:
* Sign in to Loomio ( decisions.oric.gov.au )
* Read and comment on threads
* Vote in polls and proposals
* See how your governance practices work in Loomio

**Using this Guide**

There are a series of steps to the guide. Work through these or navigate to a section using the table of contents.  Reach out to [Loomio support](https://www.loomio.org/contact) for further help if needed.

# Self-assessment for board readiness 

Good communication today requires Directors to be able to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet; capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, viewing videos and reading electronic documents.

Success of using an online tool like Loomio to communicate with your board requires Directors to be familiar with basic apps such as email, internet browser, document and video viewers.

Here is a quick check list to review with each Director:

* An up-to-date computer or smart phone with email, internet browser and video viewer
* Connection to the internet via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)

Know how to :

* Send/Receive email, browse the internet and open links to go to web pages
* If Director is not comfortable using their computer or smart phone, is there a person in the organisation, friend of family member who can help them with these things?

Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old out-of-date browsers are not supported, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.

[Contact Loomio support](https://www.loomio.com/contact) to let us know if you have problems with Loomio on your device.

# 1. Set up your board on Loomio

## Group settings

Your Loomio group is pre-configured to help you get started. As a Connector you have been given administration rights for the group.  This means you can edit group settings.

Please review each of the following settings and change to suit your organization.

*On your group home page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit group settings**.*

**Group name**: The name of your organization is the default. Do you want to change this?

**Handle**: A simplified label for your group that you can share with others, *e.g. decisions.oric.gov.au/loomio*.
	
- ***Tip**: Short names work best for your handle.*

**Cover image**: Upload an image that represents your organization. *(Replace the stock image.)*

**Logo**: Upload your logo to appear alongside your group name when people visit your group.

**Group Description**: The group description is the first place people see when they arrive into your group. This helps new people as they join your group to understand the purpose of the group, what work you are going to do, and provide any other information that helps people as they participate.

A template description for your group is provided. You can edit or replace with your own text, upload or link to any relevant documents. A wide range of formatting tools are available to help you, including:

* **Attach files**: Use the paper clip icon to attach files from your computer. *(Find this just below the group description box.)*
* **Insert link**: Go to the internet page you want to link to, copy the link to your clipboard. Highlight the text that you want to link. Click Insert link and paste the link and click Apply.

# 3. Invite board members

Now we have prepared our Loomio group, let’s invite directors.

On your group home page, go to the **Members** tab.

On the Members page you can see who are the members of your Loomio group.  You can also easily see when a member joined your group, and any invitations that have not yet been accepted.

You can remind people you have invited with **Resend invitation**, give anyone administrator level access with **Make admin** and add a person’s title with **Set title** such as Chairperson.

*Example:*

![](members-tab.png#width-80)

## Invite people

You can invite people to join the Loomio group either by sending a message to their email address via Loomio, or **Share** an invitation link via your email service or in a newsletter.

* Click **Invite**
* Type or copy/paste the email addresses of the directors you want to invite

You can add an optional message to encourage people to click the invitation button:

*Example:*

*Hi, please join our private Loomio group. We use this space to notify directors of meetings, prepare and vote on resolutions, discuss topics between meetings, and to record decisions in a searchable archive.*


***Tip**: If you have a lot of people to invite, you can copy up to 100 email addresses at a time from a list, such as from a spreadsheet column.*

*Example:*

![](invite-people.png#width-80)

# 4. Start a first thread

Start a thread to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We can use this thread to introduce Loomio to directors, and invite them to post a comment.

**Objective: Let’s get each director to post a comment so we know that directors are connected.**

* On your group home page, go to the **Threads** tab.
* Click **New Thread**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ednBbOD.png#border-none)

**Thread**

Threads are where your group can discuss a topic, exchange information and make decisions together. Threads keep everything about a topic in the same place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your group’s discussions and decisions.

***Tip**: Use a Loomio thread instead of writing an email.*

*All the information, discussion and replies are in one place, where you can see who has read the thread, and nudge people if needed; avoiding email chain confusion.*

**Group** - Select the group or subgroup you want to post the thread in. When started, your thread will be visible to the members of your group or subgroup.

You can also select **Invite-only thread (no group)** if you want to have a private discussion with one or more people, or if you want to draft a thread before posting in your group.

**Title** - Give your thread a title; this is usually announcing a topic or asking a question. Keep it short and to the point.  A thread title is like the subject line in an email.

**Notify** - You can choose to notify people by sending them an email of the thread via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.

* Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.  
* Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.

**Tag** - Choose a tag for your thread to make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic, or create a new tag.

**First thread suggestion**

# 5. Start a first Poll
Let’s start a poll to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We use Polls and Proposal to make decisions and request a response.

**Objective: Let's get everyone to vote in a poll, so they're ready when we get to work.**

You start a **Poll** or **Proposal** from within a Thread.

* Go to the thread that you wish to start your poll and click on the **Poll** tab.
* Select the type of poll you want to use. Let’s start with **Check**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vq5DB6A.png#border-none)

**Start Check**

A check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.

Use it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: *"I'm coming to the event"*, *"I'll join the subcommittee"* or *"I have completed my actions"*.

A day before the check closes, Loomio will remind people who have not participated.

**Title** - Give your poll a title. Keep it short and to the point.  

**Tags** - Select a tag that will help people easily find this poll when searching.

**Details** - Explain what you are asking people to do and how to participate.

**Options** - Select the poll voting options.  Each poll type provides different options.

**Closing date and time** - Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.

**Reminder** - 24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is **Undecided voters**.

**Who can vote?** - You can decide who is voting; anyone in your group or only the people you specifically invite.

The default settings is everyone in the group can see who has voted. However you can select anonymous voting if you want to keep the identity of voters secret. 

***Tip**: Anonymous voting is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.

**Check poll suggestion**

![](https://i.imgur.com/SpLVTMc.png#border-none)

**Invite to vote** - You can choose to invite people by sending them an email of the poll via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.

* Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.
* Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.

**Voting**

Here is what people will see when responding to a Poll request to vote:

# 6. Subgroups

Do you need a subgroup? Subgroups help you organize the work of particular groups of people; for example a subcommittee, working group or project team. You may also set up a subgroup for communicating with membership.

Subgroups work just like groups and are located within your "parent" group or organization.

Most of the features and settings are the same as in your parent group, and include the ability to allow members of the parent group to see, but not participate in, threads and polls in the subgroup. This is helpful if you want to offer transparency of discussions and decisions to members of the parent group.

A person can be a member of your subgroup and not of your parent group.

Typical subgroups for Indigenous Corporations include:
* Financial subcommittee
* Health & Safety
* Risks & Audits
* Industry-specific subgroup such as Property

![](board-subgroups.png#border-none)

## Set up a subgroup

On your group home page, go to the **Subgroups** tab and click **New Subgroup**.

Follow a similar process as in [Step 1](#1-set-up-your-board-on-loomio) to set up your subgroup.

![](https://i.imgur.com/loeydDj.png#border-none)

**Permissions**

To allow members of your parent group see threads in the subgroup:

On your subgroup home page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit group settings**.

Change permissions by ticking or un-ticking the check box.

# Why Loomio?

Loomio is an online place for the board to have discussions and make decisions together:

* Accessible, transparent and inclusive; stay connected wherever you have internet access
* Build consensus
* A safe place for all communications, information, deliberations, decisions and records of the the board
* Prepare for meetings and follow up with minutes and actions

Push admin tasks onto Loomio to free up meeting time for discussions that matter:
