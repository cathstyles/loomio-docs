# Guide for directors using Loomio

Loomio is a private and secure service for your board to **talk about matters, make decisions and keep track** of everything.

You can use it to prepare for meetings and to handle the administrative work of meeting notices, agendas, minutes. Importantly, you can also use Loomio to vote on resolutions. Using Loomio means that when you do meet as a board, you can focus on important things that can only happen when you're together.

This Loomio service is provided by the Office of Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC) as part of a project to strengthen governance. Your group will be in the following ORIC domain: **decisions.oric.gov.au** << *(bookmark that address in your browser)*

Although this service is provided by ORIC, no one from ORIC has access to your group. It's **private** for your board members and whoever else you invite.

# Create your path into Loomio

You will receive an email invitation to join your board's Loomio group. Joining is easy. You don’t need a password, and your computer will remember you (if you let it).

**Respond to the email invitation**

Your invitation to join a Loomio group will arrive in your email inbox. In the middle of the email is a button to **Accept invitation**. Use it! It will open a webpage where you can create an account on the service at decisions.oric.gov.au.

On your computer you will see a button to **CONTINUE WITH EMAIL**. Use that button and you will land at a page to create your Loomio user account:

Type in your name, so people in your group will recognise you.

Use the **CREATE ACCOUNT** button, bottom-right. You will then have an account on decisions.oric.gov.au. 

# Upload profile photo (Optional)

If you upload a picture of yourself, it will display next to all the comments you make. That makes it easy for other directors to see who said what. But if you prefer, you can choose to instead *Use initials* (the first letters of your first and last name).

![](set-profile-photo.png#width-80)

If you do want to add a photo to your profile, select **Upload new photo**. Browse to a suitable photo file from your computer. (When it displays, it will be small, so a photo of your face is best.)

Once you select the photo you want, use the button marked **Open** to upload it.
