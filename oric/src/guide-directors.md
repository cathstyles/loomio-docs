# Guide for Director users

Loomio is a private and secure software service for your Corporation board.

It is a safe place online where you can receive notifications of meetings, read documents, comment and ask questions, vote on resolutions, discuss topics between meetings, and search a record of past decisions and discussion.

This Loomio service is provided by the Office of Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC) as part of a pilot service to help directors of Corporations with good governance.

You can recognise the official service designation by the following internet address and email headers:

Decisions.oric.gov.au *(bookmark this in your browser)*

Only people invited to your Loomio group have access to see and comment on discussions and decisions.  Although this service is provided by ORIC, no one from ORIC has access to your group.
