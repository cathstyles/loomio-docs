# Setting up for success

*This page will help your board make best use of Loomio's platform and tools.*

Adopting Loomio will take conscious effort. It means a new way of working—as a whole board and as individual directors. 

Using Loomio can save you time and improve your decisions and your accountability. But to reap those rewards, the first step is to agree on how to make best use of the platform and the tools. 'Best use' is not universal; it depends on the circumstances of your corporation and your directors. 

**Key questions to consider:**

1. [What structure suits our board?](#what-structure-suits-our-board)
2. [When should we invite outsiders in?](#when-should-we-invite-outsiders-in)
3. [How will our governance work adapt?](#how-will-our-governance-work-adapt)

## What structure suits our board?
A Loomio group comprises a 'parent group' and any number of 'subgroups'. 

Subgroups are separate from the parent group but connected to it, and they work just like groups. Subgroups help focus and contain the work of particular groups of people, such as a committee, council or project team. 

You can keep a subgroup private, so that parent group members can't see anything in it. But maybe you want the subgroup to be readily accountable to the parent group. If so, you can set it so members of the parent group can see (but not respond to) threads and polls in the subgroup. 

As an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, and depending on your size, you might have a subgroup for:
* a finance committee
* a health & safety committee
* a risk & audit committee
* industry-specific tasks, such as managing property

Importantly, you can add outsiders to a subgroup—such as a lawyer or accountant or staff-member.

You could even set up a subgroup for all your members—so as directors you can share information and engage with the broader membership.

## When should we invite outsiders in?
There may be times when it would be useful to involve someone from outside the corporation in a particular discussion. As noted above, an external person can be part of a subgroup. In any one thread of the main (parent) group, you also have the option to invite an outsider in—to see and respond. At the top of every thread is a button to 'invite'. When you hit it, you can add an email address. 

You might want some protocols for inviting external people. For example:
- Do you need the board to approve, before you send an invitation — or at least the chair? 
- Or do you agree as a board that any one of you can use your discretion to invite someone in as you see fit? 
- Will you want to remove the extra person after a certain time?

## How will our governance work adapt?

Below we describe how you could perform typical governance tasks in Loomio.


1. You might use a Loomio thread to **take strategic action** ahead of the next board meeting:

| Strategic activity                                                          | Loomio tools      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start thinking** about the next board meeting                    | **New thread**—Give it a **title** that will make sense to everyone, and add some notes about the **context** for the thread, eg: thinking about the next phase of our governance work       |
| **Agree on a focus** for the meeting                    | **New comment**—What's the most important focus for this meeting? You could suggest something, or invite responses to the open question. You might reach general agreement through discussion. Or you could use a **proposal** or **poll** to clarify. |
| Check progress on the **actions arising** from the last meeting | **New comment**—use a **checklist** to post a list of tasks and who they were assigned to, and ask each person to check them off and/or comment.  |
| **Share** information and ideas to consider in relation to the strategic or business plan            | **New comment**—introduce a report or other material relevant to the strategy or operations, and invite responses. You can **attach a file** or **link** to a published document.                                              |


2. When it's time to **get organised for the next meeting**, set up a new thread dedicated to preparing for it:

| Announcing the next meeting                         | Loomio tools |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Notice** of meeting                                     | Create a **new thread**. In its **context**, note the date, time and place for the scheduled meeting. You can edit these details if the meeting is moved.                                       |
| Post the **agenda**                                         | In a **new comment**, list all items on the agenda.                                                  |
| **Focus discussion** on an agenda item                    | Add a **new comment** to elaborate on an agenda item and focus discussion on it. To ensure it's easy to find this conversation in the thread, **pin it** to the **timeline** (the mini-navigation in the sidebar on the right) |
| Ask the board to accept the **minutes** of the last meeting. | Add a **check** (yes/no poll) so directors can either approve the minutes or note corrections. Proposals and polls of all kinds are automatically included in the sidebar navigation ('timeline').                                                                                                                            |
| Add any proposed **resolutions**                             | If you are proposing a resolution, add a **proposal**.                                                                                           |
| As they become available, add financial **reports** and other board papers          | A **new comment** can introduce financial and other reports and invite discussion. Or you could get straight to the point and add the reports through a **poll or proposal** and ask directors to review the accounts and either accept or question them.                                  |
| Set a **new date for the meeting** | If you need to postpone the meeting, you can use a **time poll** to suggest a few possible options and invite everyone to mark which dates are doable for them. The result will make it easy to see the best time to meet. |

## If we do this, will we meet our statutory obligations?

Because Loomio discussions and decisions are always already documented, it provides a robust way to verify all your board's decision-making. You can easily demonstrate what was decided, and when. If directors have discussed and commented, as well as voted on a resolution—you will also know how and why each decision was reached. 

A resolution passed in between meetings is valid if (and only if) *all* eligible directors agree on it. If you have less than 100% agreement, or if some directors have not voted, you will need to take the resolution to your next board meeting (whether online or in person). Then, you can use quorum and majority rules to ratify (formally approve) the decision. The Loomio record will give you a good sense of any issues with the proposed resolution. So it shouldn't take long to resolve the matter one way or the other. 

Remember to include the decision in the minutes.

## How quickly do we expect each other to respond?
Loomio is like email in that you can respond at a time that suits you. But everyone has different work habits, and taking too long to respond is likely to be frustrating for others.

In the early days of using Loomio, it will really help if everyone responds as soon as they can with a comment, vote or reaction. That way, things can keep moving.

On the other hand, when posting a thread or comment, don't expect instant responses. Give people time to read and digest the information—especially when it's a complex or important matter.

It's up to you to manage your expectations in relation to response times. There are also tools in Loomio to prompt people to respond. You can send a reminder, or you can @mention someone by name to notify them of your comment.

Posting a poll or a proposal can also alert people that things are happening, and that now is the time to have their say.

If some people are still not responding, raise a discussion at your next board meeting and seek agreement on the importance of good communication and commitment to timely response. 

---

## When should we notify people of group activity?

There are many places within Loomio that you can notify people including when you:
* invite people to a thread
* invite people to respond to a poll or proposal
* @mention a specific person within a comment

When you notify a person, you are sending them an email. So to avoid overloading their inbox, it's usually best to only notify people when something important is happening, or if you really need to get their attention.

If you are setting up a thread to notify directors about the next meeting, it may include several polls and proposals. Rather than sending a notification for each one, it is better to notify people once, about the thread, and ask them to read through, comment and vote in any polls or proposals.  

As a board you might want to establish a protocol that works for you, so you receive the notifications you need and avoid being overwhelmed.

---
## When should we start a new thread?

Threads usually focus on a particular topic.  As the discussion progresses on the topic, the thread continues until it reaches an outcome.  

If a new topic is introduced during your discussion in the thread, you may wish to start a new thread.  In the new thread, you can add links to the old thread and even to specific comments, making reference to the previous discussion.

There are tools within Loomio that enable you to copy, edit and move comments to another thread.

Here are some typical reasons to start a new thread:
* for all the exchange about an upcoming meeting (for directors or members)
* to prepare a budget for the next financial year
* to explore an important question
* to collaborate on a policy document

---
## How do we know what kind of poll to use?

Loomio offers various kinds of poll. They are useful in a wide range of circumstances, and sometimes there's no clear-cut reason for using one over another. 

You will likely find the following polls valuable for governance activity.

### Check  

A check poll has many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or a cross (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the cross (✘) to say no or unsure.

Check if directors are ready for the next board meeting. It's good to know that people are prepared, and important to know if someone is missing some important information.  

*Add Check Poll image*

### Poll

A simple poll can be useful for approving minutes of a directors meeting.

If the minutes are in a file (e.g. a Word document), attach the file to the Poll. In the Poll description, ask directors to vote to **Accept** or **Review** if they see anything they would like to discuss.

Set **Accept** and **Review** as the Poll options.

### Time poll

Use a time poll to find the best time to meet and ask directors to respond. It will enable them to also see other's availability and juggle their calendars if they can.

## When should we use a proposal instead of a poll?

Proposals are best when there's only really one option on the table. For example, you might use a proposal to agree:

* to lodge a funding application
* on the new terms of a lease
* to approve the annual financial statements
* to form a subcommittee
* to put a special resolution to members
* on a shift in strategic direction
* to invite a guest to a board meeting
* to recruit the preferred candidate for CEO 
* to accept an insurance quotation
