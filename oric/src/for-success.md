# Setting up for success in Loomio

*This page will help your board make best use of Loomio's platform and tools.*

To successfully shift your board's processes into a new technology platform will take conscious effort. You need to build new patterns of work — as a whole board and as individual directors. 

Using Loomio can save you time and improve your decisions and your accountability. But to reap those rewards, the first step is to agree on how to make best use of the platform and the tools. 'Best use' is not universal; it depends on the circumstances of your corporation and your directors. 

**Key questions to consider:**

1. [What structure suits our board?](#what-structure-suits-our-board)
2. [When should we invite outsiders in?](#when-should-we-invite-outsiders-in)
3. [How will our governance work adapt?](#how-will-our-governance-work-adapt)
4. [If we do this, will we meet our statutory obligations?](#if-we-do-this-will-we-meet-our-statutory-obligations)
5. [How quickly do we expect each other to respond?](#how-quickly-do-we-expect-each-other-to-respond)
6. [When should we notify people of group activity?](#when-should-we-notify-people-of-group-activity)

## What structure suits our board?
A Loomio group comprises a 'parent group' and any number of 'subgroups'. 

Subgroups help focus and contain the work of particular groups of people, such as a committee, advisory group or project team. 

Subgroups work just like groups. Most of the features and settings of subgroups are the same as in your parent group. You can keep threads in the subgroup private — that's the default — so that parent group members can't see anything. Or you can allow members of the parent group to see (but not respond to) threads and polls in the subgroup. In that way, the subgroup is readily accountable to the parent group.

Importantly, you can add people to a subgroup even if they're not a member of your main (parent) group.

An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations might have a subgroup for:
* a finance committee
* a health & safety committee
* a risk & audit committee
* an industry-specific subgroup, such as 'property'
* members — to share information and engage with your broader membership. 

When you create a subgroup, you're asked to set its privacy: **closed** or **secret**. If it's secret, members of the parent group won't even know it exists — unless you invite them into it. If it's closed, non-members can see it and ask to join. (Note that you can change the subgroup's privacy after you create it.)

Once a subgroup exists, it's important to check the **permissions** asssociated with it. You can tick a box to allow members of the parent group to see threads in the subgroup. Remember, they won't be able to respond, unless you invite them to join the subgroup.

## When should we invite outsiders in?
There may be times when it would be useful to have someone from outside the corporation, such as an accountant or other adviser, in on a particular discussion. That's no problem; at any time, ou can invite an external person to see and respond to a particular Loomio thread. At the top of every thread is a button to 'invite'. When you hit it, you can add an email address. 

You might want some protocols for inviting external people. For example:
- Do you need the board to approve, before you send an invitation — or at least the chair? 
- Or do you agree as a board that any one of you can use your discretion to invite someone in as they see fit? 
- Will you want to remove the extra person after a certain time?

### Out of session decision
**Board work process:**
* When there is insufficient time or information available during your meeting, and you need to continue the discussion about a topic and make a decision before the next board meeting.
* Make administrative decisions. (For example, approving annual insurance renewals.)
* Build consent for strategic direction. (This may be triggered by external event or a director's particular interest.)

***On Loomio:***
*Use a Loomio **Thread** in your Loomio group to start an out-of-session discussion and a Loomio **Proposal** within the thread to make a decision.*
* *Give the thread a title that represents the topic, and provide background information and a question to get the discussion started. Attach files or link to relevant information online.*
* *Start a Proposal within the thread to make a decision*
* *Start a thread to open discussion about a strategic topic, and invite directors to contribute their thoughts, questions and comments. Attach files or link to relevant information online.*

![](out-of-session-decision.png#width-80)

*(A Loomio Proposal is a particular type of Poll that asks people to agree to a course of action and records the decision made. It let's everyone know that it is time to make a decision, and is also useful to clarify disagreement and help resolve an issue.)*

---

### Statutory requirements:
**Board work process:**
* Annual General Meeting (AGM) reporting
* Tax and annual financial statements
* ORIC reporting

***On Loomio:***
* *Use Loomio **Threads** to prepare the information necessary to meet statutory requirements, and attach appropriate documents. Invite directors to question and respond to the information.* 
* *Use Loomio **Proposal** to approve documents for filing. Directors can agree to approve or disagree to seek more information. When satisfied directors can change their vote to approve.*
* *When filed, state an **Outcome** of the proposal, along with approved report and statements, so that everyone knows the documents have been filed.*

![](statutory-requirements.png#width-80)

### Finding a meeting date

*Use a Loomio **Time Poll** to find the next meeting date.*

---

## If we do this, will we meet our statutory obligations?

Yes. Loomio enables documented discussion and decisions in one place.

Whereas some Corporations try to make decisions via email, which can be scattered and difficult to track.

**Can we run an out of session resolution?**

Yes. If you circulate a decision outside of a formal meeting it requires 100% directors to agree to it for the resolution to pass.

Exception: If you delegate a subcommittee to make a decision and report back to the board.

## How quickly do we expect each other to respond?
Loomio is like email in that you can respond at a time that suits you. However everyone has different work habits, and taking too long to respond is likely to be frustrating for others.

In the early days of using Loomio, it really helps if everyone responds as soon as they can with a comment, vote or reaction.

On the other hand, when posting a thread or comment don't expect everyone to respond immediately. Give people time to read and digest the information - particularly on complex or important topics.

If people are not responding, you can prompt them through Loomio by sending a reminder or with a comment using @mention.

Use Polls and Proposals so people can see that something is happening, and that now is the time to have their say.

If some people are still not responding, raise a discussion at your next board meeting and seek agreement on the importance of good communication and commitment to timely response. 


---
## When should we notify people of group activity?

There are many places within Loomio that you can notify people including:
* Invite to a Thread
* Invite to a Poll or Proposal
* @mention a specific person within a comment

When you notify a person, you are sending them an email. So to avoid overloading their inbox, it's usually best to only notify people when something important is happening, or if you need to get their attention.

If you are setting up a Thread to notify directors about the next meeting, it may include several Polls and Proposals.  Rather than sending notifications to every event, it is usually sufficient to notify people once about the Thread, and ask them to read the information and vote in any Polls or Proposals.  

It is a advisable to have a quick discussion with your group to establish a protocol that works for them, so they receive the notifications they need and are not overwhelmed with too many.

---
## When should we start a new thread?

Loomio Threads usually focus on a particular topic.  As the discussion progresses on the topic, the thread continues until it reaches an outcome.  

If a new topic is introduced during your discussion in the thread, you may wish to start a new thread.  In the new thread, you can add links to the old thread and even to specific comments, making reference to the previous discussion.

There are tools within Loomio that enable you to copy, edit and move comments to another thread.

Here are some common types of threads in governance:
* Holding all the information about a particular meeting
* Reports (e.g. Chief Executive or Financial subcommittee reports)
* Preparing and agreeing a Resolution
* Explore an important question
* Prepare for an event, such as a members meeting
* Collaborate on a policy document



---
## How do we know what kind of poll to use?

There are several Loomio Polls and they have a wide application. You will likely find the following Polls valuable for Board use.

### Check Poll 

A Check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.

Help directors get ready for your next meeting with Loomio Check Poll. 

Checking in with directors to ensure they're prepared and have all the information they need will save a lot of blank looks and confusion during a meeting, and save you precious meeting time.

*Add Check Poll image*

### Poll

The simple Poll can be useful for approving minutes of a directors meeting.

If the minutes are in a file (e.g. a Word document), attach the file to the Poll. In the Poll description, ask directors to vote to **Accept** or **Review** if they see anything they would like to discuss.

Set **Accept** and **Review** as the Poll options.

### Time poll

Use Loomio Time Poll to find the best time to meet and ask directors to respond. It will enable them to also see other's availability and juggle their calendars if they can.

## When should we use a proposal instead of a poll?

Proposals are a great way to make a decision with your board. For example; approving a financial report, passing a resolution or making an out of session decision.

Here are a few examples of how Proposals are used to make decisions in a board:

* Resolution to approve a funding application
* Resolution to approve new terms of lease
* Approve annual financial statements
* Form a subcommittee
* Approve statement to shareholders
* Approve strategic plan
* Inviting a guest to a board meeting
* Approving CEO hire
* Accept insurance quotation
