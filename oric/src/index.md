# A guide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations using Loomio for good decision-making and accountable governance

*This guide is intended for corporations in the ORIC–Loomio pilot program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking help to use Loomio for good governance.*

Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's **context** and set up a system and processes to serve its **purpose** and meet their **obligations** under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”*

At its heart is open communication.

Use Loomio to strengthen governance: **collaborate** beyond board meetings, **include everyone** in open, honest and respectful discussion, and **document everything** as you go.

This guide—and the templates it contains—will help your board to **communicate well**, **make good decisions** and **be accountable**.
