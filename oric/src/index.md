# A guide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations using Loomio for good decision-making

*This guide is intended for participants of the ORIC–Loomio pilot program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking help to use Loomio for good governance.*

Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, and to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion—while documenting everything.

This guide—and the templates it contains—is designed to help directors use digital tools effectively to improve communication and governance.

## Good governance guides
Good governance exists where an organisation has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organisation to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”*

Underpinning all of these principles is good communication.
