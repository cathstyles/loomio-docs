# Security overview
_Keeping customer data safe and secure is a huge responsibility and a top priority for us. Here’s how we make it happen._

### Practices we have at Loomio

* We never have and never will sell customer data.
* We don’t run ads for other services in our products.
* We limit the data we collect: if we don’t need it, we don’t ask for it.
* We put a lot of security measures into place including in-transit encryption and encryption at-rest.

# Security overview.

## Trustworthy staff

Employee and contractor agreements for people working at Loomio include confidentiality clauses to protect Loomio and customer confidential information. We treat all customer information and data as confidential, except for situations where a customer has explicitly made the information publicly accessible.

## We protect your data.

All data are written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

TODO - rewrite this page, heavily reusing https://help.loomio.org/en/user_manual/privacy/

Loomio is open source software

This means the code is open to view, but your data is not. There are many benefits including that many people have read our code and review changes as they go in. We've got nothing to hide - there are no backdoors in Loomio.

Heroku utilises ISO 27001 and FISMA certified data centres managed by Amazon. Information about security at Amazon data centres is available here.
Backup data and Recovery

Loomio software and data recovery are managed by Heroku. The software and data is automatically backed up as part of the deployment process on secure, access controlled, and redundant storage. Heroku use these backups to deploy the Loomio software and data across the platform and automatically bring the application back online in the event of an outage.

More information can be found at Heroku’s security policy.

## Your data are sent using HTTPS.

Whenever your data are in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS. Within our firewalled private networks, data may be transferred unencrypted.

Any files which you upload to us are stored and are encrypted at rest. Our application databases are generally not encrypted at rest — the information you add to the applications is active in our databases and subject to the same protection and monitoring as the rest of our systems.

## Over 9 years in business.

We’ve been around the block and we’ve seen a lot of companies come and go. Security isn’t just about technology, it’s about trust. Since 1999, we’ve worked hard to earn the trust of over hundreds of thousands of companies world wide. We’ll continue to work hard every day to maintain that trust. Longevity and stability is core to our mission at Loomio.
