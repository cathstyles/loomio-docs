### Typical direct questions:

### Broader questions directors should have confidence in:

2. What is our relationship with our accounting firm - or do we need one if we don't have one?

3. Why do we close the books and produce the financial statements on X workday each month and is that OK?

4. How can we become more accurate in our cashflow forecasting?

5. What are the best metrics for measuring our profitability and productivity?

6. If we are ever in challenging times, where can we tighten our belts?

### Do you need a Finance Subcommittee?

Consider:

1. Is our organisation so complex that managing finances becomes difficult to understand without understanding the complex details?

2. Is our cashflow always under consideration? *For example, if you are a startup and your cash runway only extends a few months and small changes in financial position have large strategic implications.*

3. Are you a large entity? *I.e if you are managing a large quantity of money - ensuring good oversight is critical.*

4. Do you have lots of compliance and accountability responsibilities to adhere to? *How are you ensuring that the company/org is meeting requirements?*
