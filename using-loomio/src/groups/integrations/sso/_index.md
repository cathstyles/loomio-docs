We support authentication against the SAML 2.0 directory services, this is supported by services such as OneLogin, Auth0, or Microsoft Azure Directory.

SSO is available to all organizations with a Pro subscription and is currently in a public beta phase.

We aim to provide detailed step-by-step setup guides for the services our customers use, if you use a provider not listed above, please email contact@loomio.org and let us know. We'll create a guide for you.
