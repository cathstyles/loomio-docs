A group handle gives your group an easy to say, and easy to remember url for your Loomio group.

For example the Loomio community's handle is `community` so it is reachable via loomio.org/community.

Currently handles are available to groups on paid subscriptions. To request a handle for your group please [contact us]({{ site.loomio_app_url }}/contact_us).
